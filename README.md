# Flask Microblog

Here's my sub-repository chronicling the development of my "microblog" using Miguel Grinberg's 23-part Flask Mega-Tutorial.

[Click here](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) to check out Miguel's series.

As of the most current commit, this project has been completed up to Chapter 16 of Miguel's tutorial.
